## 📋Overview

The challenge is to build out the recipe page and get it looking as close to the design as possible using semantic HTML, modern CSS, and good accessibility practices.

### 🎖️The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the recipe page on different screen sizes without losing readability or layout structure
- Read the content clearly with proper visual hierarchy
- Navigate the page using assistive technologies thanks to semantic HTML and accessible markup
- View images and content that adapt correctly to different devices

- Responsive design with `clamp()`

### ✨Features

- Responsive and accesible recipe page
- Semantic HTML and clean CSS architecture

### 📚What I learned

During this project I reinforced:

- How to structure a page using semantic HTML elements such as `main`, `article`, `section`, and `header`
- Applying the BEM methodology to organize CSS in a clear and maintainable way
- Building responsive layouts using a mobile-first approach Flexbox and Grid
- Using modern CSS features like `clamp()` to handle responsive typography and spacing
- Managing layout consistency with CSS custom properties
- Improving accessibility through proper heading hierarchy, readable contrast, and accessible table structures
- Writing cleaner CSS by avoiding unnecessary wrappers and duplicated rules

### ♿Accessibility

This project follows basic WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility guidelines, using semantic HTML, proper heading hierarchy, and accessible table structures to improve screen reader support.

### 🚀Continued development

In future projects, I want to:

- Continue improving accessibility by testing with screen readers
